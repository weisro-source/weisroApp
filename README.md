## Page Naming Convention

In this Flutter project, we follow a consistent naming convention for all screen or page files to maintain clarity and organization.

### Naming Guidelines:

- **File Name:** Use lowercase with underscores separating words (e.g., `profile_page.dart`).
- **Class Name:** Use PascalCase, and ensure the class name ends with `Page` (e.g., `ProfilePageView`).
- **Page Reference:** In documentation and code comments, always refer to these screens as a "`Page`".

### Example

- **File Name:** `settings_page.dart`
- **Class Name:** `SettingsPageView`

By adhering to these naming conventions, it becomes easier for team members to identify and work with page files throughout the project, ensuring consistency across the codebase.
